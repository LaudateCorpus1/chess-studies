the most popular move, f3.}  8... exf4 9. Bxf4 Nc6 10. a3 $6 $146 { Lichess
novelty. The main moves here are Qe2 and Qd2, preparing for long castle. This
seemingly unnecessary move has some potential issues:  (  1  )  Black can play
Bxb3 and white has to take with the c-pawn, instead of having the additional
option to take with tha a-pawn.  (  2  )  Black has later additional options to
open some Q-side files by pushing the b pawn.[%cal Ge6b3,Gc2b3,Yb7b4,Ya3b4]}

Bxc7 )44. Bxe5 Bxe5 45. Na6 Bxh2 46. c7 Bxc7 47. Nxc7 f5 { Here Leela thinks
she is somewhat better with black. This misevaluation is probably due to
visuals, as the K-side black pawns look intimidating. If one does not
calculate, it is plausible to think that black has time to march the king to
support the a5-pawn and overrun the king-side with the pawn wall. However,
white has an easy plan here. White has time to take the a5 pawn, and the knight
can then move to blockade the Q-side pawns. The g2 pawn guarantees than at
least one black pawn will be exchanged, and the knight can stop two black pawns
with ease with the "L" defensive pattern. This position is now a forced win for
white with best play.}  48. Ne6 Kf7 49. Nd8+ Kf6 50. Nb7 a4 51. Nc5 g5 52. Nxa4

57. c3 h2 58. Nf2 { Now the knight controls the h1 and f2 squares, and black
pawns cannot promote alone. However, the king can offer limited assistance,
since it also needs to watch the c-pawn. Further, it is important to note that
the knight can jump freely between the h1 and f2 squares to lose tempi. Losing 
(  or gaining  )  tempi is important when pushing the c-pawn to avoid any
stalemate tricks by black. With only the white king-pawn vs black king, this
would be a draw. [%csl Rf2,Rh1]}  58... Ke5 59. Kd2 Kd5 60. Kd3 Ke5 61. Ke3 Kd5

This little move deserves a special attention. While this may look like a
prophylaxis, it also puts the king in the same diagonal with Bd7. This make e6
pawn a bit less weak, since white has to spend an extra tempo move the king
away from the diagonal before e6 can be captured without a pin. However, with
the king safety being questioned, being sheltered by an enemy pawn is probably
better than leaving the king in g2. Kg2 would be vulnerable to d4 and check
